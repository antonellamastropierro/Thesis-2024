# OBJECTIVE 4: Create Standardized Bio Raster Layers for Hypervolume Calculations
# Purpose: the selected bio variables currently have different means, standard deviations,
#...and methods of measurements (i.e. temp (degree C), precipitation(mm)).
# Standardizing all the bio variables to have a mean=0 and SD=1 allows for consistency
#...throughout all bio variable measurements for better comparison.
# The bio variable raster layers should be standardized before bio variable extraction to eliminate
#...continuously having to standardize them after extraction.

# Standardization is completed through Z-score transformation so that:
# mean = 0
# SD = 1
# Z-score transformation equation: Z = (x-u)/o
# x = data point value
# u = mean value
# o = standard deviation

# convert bio variable spatraster (bio_AOI) into a raster stack with 7 layers representing each
#...bio variable

# now there is a bio raster stack containing the 7 standardized bio variables

# convert the standardized bio rasterstack to a dataframe to be used for Section 3 and 4

################################################################################
# CONCLUSION: Now that that the bio variables have been reduced to only independent
  # ...variables and have been isolated both within the AOI as well as within the alpine
  #...climate locations within the AOI, an alpine VS can be created with the manipulated data
# in addition, once unbiased and biased data points are retrieved, hypervolume calculations
  #...in Sections 3 and 4 will be completed using the standardized environmental data for comparison across
  #...the independent variables
