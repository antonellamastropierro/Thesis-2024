# in such case, the data frame would need to be filtered out for points with both Real and Observed = 1
  # CODE: occ_df <- sample_df[sample_df$Real == 1 & sample_df$Observed == 1, ]
  # The comma after the condition means to keep all columns of the data frame

# convert the 8 bio variables to dataframes
bio_EUR_df <- as.data.frame(bio_EUR, xy=TRUE)

# merge the occurrence and bio variable data frames together by the coords so
  #...that everything aligns properly and the remaining data frames has the occurrence
  #...points with their respective bio variable values
occ_1_bio_df <- merge(bio_EUR_df, occ_1_df, by = c("x", "y"))
# result is dataframe containing all bio variable values for the occurrence points

# to convert back to raster
occ_1_rstr <- rasterFromXYZ(occ_1_bio_df[,-(12:13)])

# plot the occurrence points with respect to a bio variable
plot(occ_1_rstr$Temp.Seasonality, col=vl)
points(alp_occ_1$sample.points, col = "black", pch = 19)
### it looks like it cuts off two of the occurrence plots

# CONCLUSION:
  # the alpine climate conditions specific to the European Alps geographic location has been
  #...isolated and a alpine-specific VS was able to be created using the 8 selected
  #...non-colinear bio variables.
  # A presence/absence plot was then created for the alpine VS revealing the realized
  #...niche of the alpine VS with respect to geographic space
  # 100 unbiased samples were pulled from the presence/absence plot in order to retrieve
  #...unbiased occurrence points with respect to geographic space
  # the alpine VS unbiased realized niche and occurrence points were the filtered
  #...in order to retrieve their respective bio variable values
  # This data will be used to create an unbiased realized ecological niche model
  #...to compare against a biased realized ecological niche model
