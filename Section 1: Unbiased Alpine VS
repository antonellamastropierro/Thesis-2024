# OBJECTIVE 1: Create and Customize an Alpine Climate-Specific Unbiased VS for the AOI
# PURPOSE: Using the isolated bio variables values in the alpine climate conditions
  #...of the  AOI, an unbiased custom alpine climate species can be created to
  #....be sampled.
# PART A: Retrieve mean and standard deviation values for selected bio variables
# PART B: Create suitability map of alpine-specific unbiased VS in the AOI using alpine parameters

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PART A: Retrieve mean and standard deviation values for selected bio variables

# the spatraster containing the values at each pixel need to be converted to dataframes
# ...in order to retrieve the mean and sd values for each of the 7 bio variable
# ...to input into our custom alpine VS

# convert the masked Europe alpine climate-specific spatraster into a dataframe
bio_AOI_alp_df <- as.data.frame(bio_AOI_alp)

# view the dataframe
glimpse(bio_AOI_alp_df)
# now it's a dataframe, showing all the values of each of the 8 variables located
#... specifically in the alpine climate areas of Europe

# Get the means and SDs of each variable to input later into the VS

# to get the means of all 7 variables at the same time
colMeans(bio_AOI_alp_df)
# Annual Temp = -2.53
# Isothermality = 0.31
# Temp Seasonality = 724.26
# Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter = 2.80
# Mean Temperature of Driest Quarter = -8.77
# Annual Precip = 1783.65
# Precipitation Seasonality = 27.32

# retrieve SD of all 7 variables
summarize_all(bio_AOI_alp_df, sd)
# Annual Temp = 2.14
# Isothermality = 0.16
# Temp Seasonality = 26.61
# Mean Temperature of Wettest Quarter = 5.29
# Mean Temperature of Driest Quarter = 5.85
# Annual Precip = 432.63
# Precipitation Seasonality = 10.56

# the means and SDs have now been determined for the necessary 7 variables
# these values will be used as parameters to create a custom alpine-specific VS

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PART B: Create suitability map of alpine-specific unbiased VS in the AOI using alpine parameters

# first create parameters for alpine species using the mean and SD values retrieved from PART A
# the raster used will be the AOI bio variable raster to show the VS suitability in relation to the AOI

# OBJECTIVE 2: Create Presence/Absence (Realized Niche) of VS and Sample First 100 Occurrences

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# PART A: Convert VS to presence/absence (total realized niche)

# now that the alpine VS is created, it can be converted to a P/A plot in order to
  # determine it's realized niche. The realized niche will be the presence-only raster

# use converttoPA() function to convert the suitability plot into a binary presence/absence plot

# lower beta = wider distribution range (increase probability of finding suitable conditions)
# higher beta = smaller distribution range (decrease probability of finding suitable conditions)
# alpha = slope of curve ranging from linear to logistic to threshold like
# species prevalence: number of places occupied by the species
  #... out of the total number of available places
# alpha = -0.05 is set as a logistic-like curve
# beta = is set to random since it goes hand-in-hand with species prevalence
# species.prevalence = 0.05. The area within the AOI that is identified as alpine climate
  #...covers 10% of the AOI, so the species prevalence should be less than 10%.
  # For the sake of this project, since alpine climate areas are at high altitudes where
  #...there are not many road systems, increasing the species prevalence will increase
  #...the probability of occurrence at lower altitudes where road systems are present so
  #...that some biased data based on roadside bias can be retrieved.

# CONCLUSION:
  # a virtual species has been created who's suitability is based on alpine climate
  #...conditions.
  # a presence/absence plot was created showing the total realized niche (presence points)
  #...of the alpine species.
  # 200 presence-only samples were collected from the P/A plot created. The sampled occurrences
  #...are unbiased and represent a subset of the total realized niche (actual realized niche)
